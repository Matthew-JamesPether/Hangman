# Hangman

I Developed a Hangman game using React. It selects a random word from a dictionary text file and displays each letter as underscores. A keyboard is provided for the user to choose a letter. When the right letter is selected the appropriate underscore will change to the selected letter. If the user selects wrong a picture will begin to be drawn. The user is allowed 10 incorrect guesses. When all wrong guesses are used up the word will be presented and a stick man being hung will be drawn indicating the user has lost. When the game is over the user will be allowed to restart by selecting the restart button.
